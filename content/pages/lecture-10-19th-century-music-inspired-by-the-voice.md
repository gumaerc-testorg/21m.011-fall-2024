## Listening

### Giuseppe Verdi, beginning of Act 1 of *La Traviata* (opera)

Recall from week 5:

**Opera**

A story or drama presented in music. It is sung throughout using two techniques for conveying the text: 

1. Recitative (think “recitation”)

- declaiming words musically in a heightened, theatrical manner  
- moves the action of the story forward 

1. Aria

- elaborate, extended piece for solo singer  
- pauses the action in order to immerse the audience in the character’s feelings

#### Excerpts:
